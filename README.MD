# THANKS FOR CHECKING OUT THIS MINI C++ SERVER


### A SIMPLE C++ SERVER 

This template is an open-source project to act as a replacment for modern framework services serving static web environments.

From a high level perspective, VisualPlus aims to replace reliance on Frameworks for their developmental servers, in turn providing higher levels of configurable options on all aspects of a project whilst also allowing in-depth optimisation of lower level operations by relying on C++ rather than higher level languages such as the case with .NET, Flask, Django etc.,
